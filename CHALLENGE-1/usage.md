How to use this code - Challange by devchallanges 
Challenge Topic - Create a simple FAQ page using HTML and CSS
I created only one media query for mobile view with the maxium width at 640px. 
The links are clickable but they arent linked to any page. You can add the link to the href attribute of the a tag.
I wasn't sure how to align it so i put the heading in a separate div from the rest of the page .
It is a self explanatory code. You can add more questions and answers as per your requirement.
For the different questions you can use the same styling as used earlier in the page.
